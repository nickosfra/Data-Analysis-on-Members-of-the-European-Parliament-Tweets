# Data-Analysis-on-Members-of-the-European-Parliament-Tweets
In terms of the course **Applied Machine Learning** under the supervision of [Panos Louridas](https://github.com/louridas), this repository contains analysis on tweets made by the Members of the European Parliament.

## Analysis

The assignment consists of **2 main Sections**, which are explicitly stated in the [Assignment Description](https://github.com/nickosfra/Data-Analysis-on-Members-of-the-European-Parliament-Tweets/blob/master/twitter_meps.ipynb). Briefly, the project focuses on:
- preparing the dataset to be used for analysis
- clustering the tweets based on their text
- classifying an unseen tweet to a political party after training two algorithms on the existing tweets' text

The analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/nickosfra/Data-Analysis-on-Members-of-the-European-Parliament-Tweets/blob/master/Twitter_MEPS-Analysis.ipynb).

## Dataset

The project uses data collected by Darko Cherepnalkoski, Andreas Karpf, Igor Mozetič, and Miha Grčar for their paper [Cohesion and Coalition Formation in the European Parliament: Roll-Call Votes and Twitter Activities](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0166586). The dataset can be found [here](https://www.clarin.si/repository/xmlui/handle/11356/1071), while the file used in the analysis is the `retweets.csv`.
